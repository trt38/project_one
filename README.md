<p><b>Topic:</b> Drinking Water Standard Violations vs. Median Household Income</p>
<p><b>Title:</b> Sip, Sip… Pass?</p>

<p><b><i>Outline</i></b></p>
<p><b>Description:</b> This project analyzes the correlation between median household income and reported drinking water safety violations in US counties in 2018.</p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Hypothesis:</b> We hypothesize that if there is a negative correlation between median household income and drinking water safety violations.</li>
<li><b>Null Hypothesis:</b> There is not a significant linear correlation between median household income and drinking water safety violations.</li>

<p><b>Research Questions:</b>
<ol>
  <li>What, if any, impact does income have on the adherence to drinking water safety regulations?</li>
  <li>What is the relationship between income and drinking water safety across United States counties?</li>
  <li>What are the top five chemicals referenced in the violations?</li>
  <li>What are the most prevalent potential health effects in the areas with the most drinking water safety violations?</li>
</ol></P>

  <li>Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in the presentation. (Kai)</li>
  <li>Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions. (Tatiana)</li>
  <li>Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and  any relevant plots. (Tatiana)</li>
